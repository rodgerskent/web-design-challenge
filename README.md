# web-design-challenge

Description
Data is more powerful when we share it with others. This project expands our HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills to create a dashboard to communicate project results. We utilized the output from our earlier API projects WeatherPy and VacationPy and focused our efforts on a high impact HTML enabled dashboard. 

Key Deliverables
•	Seven web pages that were all linked:
  o	Landing page / Overview page
  o	Temperature focused page
  o	Humidity focused page
  o	Cloudiness focused page
  o	Wind Speed focused page
  o	Combined, Comparisons page
  o	Data page with a responsive HTML data table
•	Navigation
  o	The HTML pages included three navigation means: a) navigation bar (I chose pills for each of use and visual appeal, b) drop down menu to navigate to the plots and c) navigation enabled figures so that the user could click on a chart (plot) and go to the respective page. 
•	Sizing and Responsive
  o	Pages were constructed in Bootstrap grid format to enable constructive resizing required for different screen sizes. 

Topline (3 Key) Takeaways
1.	Maximum temperature is highly correlated with latitude
2.	Humidity, cloudiness and wind speed are not correlated with latitude
3.	Western Australia is looking like somewhere I would like to visit on holiday
